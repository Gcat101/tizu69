│Hi! I'm @tizu69. I develop     │
│apps for Windows in C#. I      │
│recently started liking TUIs   │
│(text-based user interface)    │
│and now actually prefer them   │
│over normal GUIs.              │

│ My story as a developer   │ X │
├───────────────────────────┴───┤
│ I'm not one of those people   │
│ that have 10 years experience │
│ in everything. Not at all; I  │
│ started developing apps for   │
│ Windows in 2016 or 2017, I    │
│ don't know exactly. Back then │
│ I started with Visual Basic   │
│ and WinForms. I created basic │
│ applications for personal     │
│ use. I won't get into them    │
│ further here, they were not   │
│ more than cringe. Back then I │
│ had this weird habit where    │
│ I'd always start new projects │
│ and almost never fish them.   │
│ I started C# development in   │
│ 2018 or 2019. Since then I    │
│ have not touched VB once.     │
│ When I got a new 4K display I │
│ noticed that WinForms sucks   │
│ because the designer is not   │
│ DPI-aware. That's when I      │
│ switched to WPF. And I tell   │
│ you what, the switch was      │
│ hard, but once I learned the  │
│ basics, great. WinForms just  │
│ does not allow that level of  │
│ detail and customization      │
│ that WPF has. With my newest  │
│ project, named "tizuWare", I  │
│ try to create a complete      │
│ application ecosystem that    │
│ intends on targeting          │
│ everyone. While there are     │
│ currently no real apps that   │
│ you can download and use,     │
│ my goal is to release new     │
│ apps that target different    │
│ topics. I plan to complete    │
│ the tAppStore by January 2023 │
│ and then release apps as fast │
│ as possible while still       │
│ keeping quality over          │
│ quantity. Let's see what the  │
│ future brings with it.        │

If only you could resize these "windows"... My problem, alright?
