│ Hi! I'm @tizu69. I develop    │
│ nothing (mostly) in Java. I   │
│ recently started liking TUIs  │
│ (text-based user interface)   │
│ and now actually prefer them  │
│ over normal GUIs.             │

│ My story as a developer   │ X │
├───────────────────────────┴───┤
│ I'm not one of those people   │
│ that have 10 years experience │
│ in everything. Not at all; I  │
│ started developing apps for   │
│ Windows in 2016 or 2017, I    │
│ don't know exactly. Back then │
│ I started with Visual Basic   │
│ and WinForms. I created basic │
│ applications for personal     │
│ use. I won't get into them    │
│ further here, they were not   │
│ more than cringe. Back then I │
│ had this weird habit where    │
│ I'd always start new projects │
│ and almost never fish them.   │
│ I started C# development in   │
│ 2018 or 2019. Since then I    │
│ have not touched VB once.     │
│ When I got a new 4K display I │
│ noticed that WinForms sucks   │
│ because the designer is not   │
│ DPI-aware. That's when I      │
│ switched to WPF. And I tell   │
│ you what, the switch was      │
│ hard, but once I learned the  │
│ basics, great. WinForms just  │
│ does not allow that level of  │
│ detail and customization      │
│ that WPF has. Now I switched  │
│ to Java.                      │

If only you could resize these "windows"... My problem, alright?
